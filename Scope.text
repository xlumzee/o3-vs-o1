Models: o3 vs o1 
	•	API: Use the Responses API (reasoning models work best there; you also get reasoning-token usage).  ￼
	•	Controls: temperature=0, identical prompts, no tools.
	•	Metrics to log: 
            correctness (✅/❌), 
            latency (s), 
            input/output/reasoning tokens, 
            and $ cost using current per-model pricing.
