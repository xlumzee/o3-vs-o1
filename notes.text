I initially started with setting up the API key from openai platform and creating the structure/scope/code

I had to add credits to the openai platform in order to do the experiments. It is separate from the gpt portal so payment information doesnt transfer.

After adding credits and fixing the code a little bit, the experiments began.

The code has been revised 3 times
I tried running only o1 first, was successfull with that 

[o1] logic_1 | 256 toks | 5.9 s | $0.01536 ❌
[o1] math_1 | 635 toks | 3.12 s | $0.03454 ❌
[o1] code_1 | 192 toks | 4.61 s | $0.01152 ❌

then i ran o1 and o3 

[o1] logic_1 | 699 toks | 4.46 s | $0.03551 ❌
[o3] logic_1 | 432 toks | 5.59 s | $0.00260 ❌
[o1] math_1 | 635 toks | 4.14 s | $0.03454 ❌
[o3] math_1 | 335 toks | 3.66 s | $0.00221 ❌
[o1] code_1 | 447 toks | 5.29 s | $0.01917 ✅
[o3] code_1 | 426 toks | 5.85 s | $0.00239 ❌

then i revised the bench.py and made the the prompts shorter and concise and then it again

[o1] logic_1 | 473 toks | 2.72 s | $0.02564 ❌
[o3] logic_1 | 207 toks | 8.45 s | $0.00129 ❌
[o1] math_1 | 1066 toks | 5.49 s | $0.06207 ❌
[o3] math_1 | 306 toks | 2.45 s | $0.00220 ✅
[o1] code_1 | 448 toks | 7.03 s | $0.02688 ❌
[o3] code_1 | 609 toks | 7.27 s | $0.00429 ❌

then i created the git repo and pushed everything there

[o1] logic_1 | 473 toks | 4.09 s | $0.02564 ❌
[o3] logic_1 | 253 toks | 5.21 s | $0.00166 ❌
[o1] math_1 | 1066 toks | 5.14 s | $0.06207 ❌
[o3] math_1 | 498 toks | 5.19 s | $0.00373 ✅
[o1] code_1 | 1121 toks | 6.04 s | $0.06290 ❌
[o3] code_1 | 437 toks | 4.39 s | $0.00291 ✅

💰 Estimated total cost: $0.1589
model correct  avg_latency_s  avg_cost_usd  avg_reason_toks
   o1     0/3           5.09      0.050200              0.0
   o3     2/3           4.93      0.002768              0.0

I will now be updating the logic for the grader, which is a prompt tweak which should make o3 better and o1 slightly better.
Made logic_1 unambiguous
making the math_1 grading more robust with a bit of flexibility
making logic_1 grading better - more forgiving
